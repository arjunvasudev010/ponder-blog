                <p>"Where were you last night? It was raining all night. I was scared all night." Wow...!, now I can hear my mama's voice more clearly. Oh, how rude of me. I am Ava. My dad calls me Ava baby. Do you know what I heard first, tup-tup-tup-tup! At first, I got frightened, but later on, I realized it was something below my neck. Now, I became more familiar with this sound and realized that something above also making this sound. I don't know where it comes from, sometimes it is much slower than mine, sometimes that may synchronize with mine sometimes it makes more tup-tups than mine. Last night, I seemed to be defeated in the tup-tups race. Not only this but other noises are also can hear. Gulu-gulu...something falls. Kudu kudu... something is broken down. At first, they heard faintly, and as the days passed, they had been getting clearer along with some other muffled sounds.</p>
                <p>One night, when my mama was sitting on a chair and my dad was trying to tell me a story, a bow-bow sound was heard suddenly I felt pressure on me, slimy things around me got tightened tup-tup sounds above counted fast, which made me raise my legs. My legs got hit on a wall. Ahh... my mama makes a painful noise.</p>
